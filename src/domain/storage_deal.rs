//! B.U.D. storage deals and retrieval challenges (Phase 0.39 §2.2 - §2.6,
//! vision §8.5).
//!
//! **Phase 9 (ARENA3, 2026-07-16): VerifyMerkle production gate AÇILDI.**
//! The BudZKVM `VerifyMerkle` opcode passed all three positive STARK tests
//! (1-depth, 2-depth, 64-depth). B.U.D. Faz 3 (real Proof-of-Storage) is now
//! active: every `open_deal` requires a valid `merkle_proof` (serialized
//! `ProofEnvelope`) and `storage_root`. The chain validates proof format
//! at deal-open time; full STARK verification is performed by nodes with
//! prover capability.
//!
//! **Phase 9 (ARENA3, 2026-07-16):** Two proof layers now coexist:
//!
//! 1. **Merkle Proof (Faz 3):** Every `open_deal` requires a valid
//!    `merkle_proof` and `storage_root`. The proof is format-validated at
//!    deal-open time (ProofEnvelope deserialization). Full STARK
//!    verification performed by prover-capable nodes.
//!    This is the **real Proof-of-Storage** (vision §8.3).
//!
//! 2. **Retrieval Challenge (Faz 5):** The interim retrieval challenge
//!    remains as an anti-unresponsiveness mechanism. An operator can
//!    pass by holding only the requested byte range — it does NOT prove
//!    full storage. Treat slashing-from-missed-challenge as a
//!    "this operator is unresponsive" signal, NOT as a "this operator
//!    is destroying provable storage" signal.
//!
//! Data-sovereignty rule (Phase 0.39 plan §0.5): anyone (any account, no
//! role required) may open a `RetrievalChallenge` and may submit a
//! `StorageDeal`. There is no team-gated "official monitor" role.
