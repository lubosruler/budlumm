//! Permissionless verifier/validator/relayer registry.
//!
//! Master-context rule: on PoW/PoS/BFT domains there is **no whitelist, no
//! admin-approval and no central gate**. Participation == staking. Security is
//! provided by economic incentive (stake) + slashing, never by permission.
//!
//! This is a shared primitive: it is generic over [`RoleId`] so future
//! application layers (out of scope here) can reuse it with their own roles.
//!
//! ## What this module intentionally does NOT do
//! - It never stores an allow-list of approved accounts.
//! - It never exposes an `approve()` / `admit()` gate for PoW/PoS/BFT roles.
//! - It knows nothing about KYC. KYC-gated membership lives in a *separate*
//!   module ([`crate::registry::poa_membership`]) with a separate data
//!   structure, so PoA's permissioned rules cannot leak in here.
