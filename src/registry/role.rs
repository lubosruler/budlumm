//! Generic, extensible role / permission types for the permissionless registry.
//!
//! Per the Budlum master-context rules the permissionless verifier/validator/
//! relayer registry MUST be a shared primitive for future application layers.
//! To avoid scope-locking it to a fixed set of roles, roles are modelled as an
//! open `RoleId` newtype rather than a hard-coded `enum`. The well-known roles
//! (validator/verifier/relayer) are provided as constants for convenience, but
//! the registry accepts *any* `RoleId` — new roles can be introduced by callers
//! without changing this module or breaking existing tests.
