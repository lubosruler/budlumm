//! Phase 0.30: liveness wired into the real epoch flow (observe mode).
//!
//! These tests drive real block production through `Blockchain::produce_block`
//! (which commits blocks and, at epoch boundaries, runs
//! `maybe_observe_liveness_on_epoch_close`) — NOT the isolated
//! `state.record_liveness_epoch()` call.
//!
//! Decision 2.3 = OBSERVE MODE: crossing the miss threshold is logged/reported
//! but NEVER slashed. Tests assert both the counter movement AND the absence of
//! any slash (stake/registry unchanged).
