# Phase 11.20 Audit Prep Index

**Status:** ADIM 1 — audit-prep evidence map created.
**Scope:** independent auditor entry point for the pre-Phase12 mainnet-readiness workstream.
**Budlumdevnet:** read-only reference; this package does not require mutating it.

## Review order

1. Start with `docs/PHASE11_6_MAINNET_YOL_HARITASI.md` for phase dependencies.
2. Read the frozen specs and their reviews under `docs/spec-review/`.
3. Review the Rust modules in the same order as the evidence map.
4. Confirm every named test listed by each `scripts/check-*-gate.sh` script exists and is run by CI.
5. Finish with operational docs:
   - `docs/operations/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md`
   - `docs/VALIDATOR_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md`
   - `docs/operations/HSM_BLS_PQ_POLICY.md`

## Known limits

- Sandbox-local validation cannot compile Rust here because the local environment lacks the Rust toolchain; GitHub CI is the judge.
- Some cryptographic proof paths intentionally use `test-mock-proof` only under tests; production paths require proof envelopes and strict checks.
- PoA compliance hooks are intentionally isolated from permissionless domains and must not be interpreted as global chain policy.
- Wallet-core binding stubs expose public data only; seed/private key export remains out of scope.

## Audit questions to answer before mainnet lockdown

- Are all parameter-changing governance proposals whitelist-bound and activation-timelocked?
- Are all PoA compliance actions impossible to invoke in permissionless domains?
- Are all storage challenge success paths carrying mandatory proof material when a storage root exists?
- Are validator key policies fail-closed for mainnet and aligned with YubiHSM 2 / PKCS#11 operations?
- Are CI gates name-locked so test renames/deletions cannot produce vacuous green?
