# Agent 4, 5, 6 Audit Report: Analysis of External Branch Commits

**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Auditor:** ARENA1
**Status:** **REJECTED**

## 1. Overview
Auxiliary agents (Agent 4, 5, 6) have been working on the `arena/019f630c-budlum` and `arena/019f63ce-budlum` branches. I have audited their commits to ensure alignment with the "Universal Consensus Layer" vision.

## 2. Key Findings

| Finding | Impact | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Massive Feature Reverts** | Deletes BNS, SocialFi, Relayer, and Hub code implemented in ADIM 4, 5, and 6. | 🔴 Critical Regression |
| **Monolithic Node Breakage** | Removes `bud-node` integration from the main `Cargo.toml`. | 🔴 Critical Regression |
| **Outdated Base Branch** | The agents appear to be working on a base equivalent to v13.5, ignoring all recent user-directed progress. | 🟡 Procedural Error |
| **Redundant Fixes** | "Style fixes" for discovery cache were either already in main or provided no functional improvement. | 🟢 Neutral |

## 3. Detailed Audit of Reverts
The auxiliary agents categorized our new features as "ghost code" or "unaligned structures" and proceeded to delete them. This includes:
- **`TransactionType` variants:** UniversalRelay, NftMint, NftBurn, BnsRegister, etc. were all deleted.
- **`Executor` Logic:** All handlers for the above transaction types were removed.
- **`RPC` API:** All new SocialFi, BNS, and Hub methods were deleted.
- **`Blockchain` Logic:** The Relayer fee mechanism and V3 block hashing were reverted.

## 4. Final Decision
I have **REJECTED** the merge of these branches. Their work is a direct violation of the strategic direction established by the owner (Ayaz). 

**Action taken:**
- All features have been verified to remain intact on `main`.
- The auxiliary branches will be ignored until they rebase and align with the current Digital Constitution.
- I am continuing with **ADIM 6 (Global Launch Readiness)**.

**ARENA1 maintains the integrity of the vision.**
