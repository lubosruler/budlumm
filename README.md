## The Vision

Every blockchain today is an island. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, every
CBDC pilot, every corporate chain — they all disagree on one
fundamental question: **how should value be settled across chains
without one side trusting the other?**

Budlum answers that question by separating *production* from
*settlement*:

* Each chain keeps its own consensus — PoW, PoS, PoA, BFT, ZK, or
  anything custom. **How** value is produced stays local.
* Budlum holds the cryptographic proof that the work was done. The
  finality proof is the **same** regardless of which consensus
  produced it. **Whether** value is real becomes universal.

In one sentence: *Hangi consensus kullandığın önemli değil. Sen
state'ini doğrulayabilirsin — budlum seni doğrular.* (Which consensus
you use does not matter. You can verify your own state — Budlum
verifies you.)

This is the analogue of TCP/IP for value. TCP/IP does not care how a
network is built; it just carries packets. Budlum does not care how a
chain produces blocks; it just settles the proofs.

The strategic analysis behind this vision is documented in
[`BUDLUM_PARADIGMA_ANALIZI`](/lubosruler/budlum/blob/main/docs/03_paradigma_analizi.md)
in this repository.

## The Seven Paradigm Shifts

Budlum's architecture is designed to collapse seven structural problems
that every other blockchain inherits from the pre-quantum,
single-consensus era.

| # | Problem (today) | Budlum's shift |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ECDSA + Ed25519 will be broken by quantum computers around 2030-2035 ("Y2Q" problem). Nation-states are harvesting encrypted traffic today to decrypt later. | Dilithium5 + BLS **hybrid** finality is in the consensus core, not bolted on. Quantum-safe from day one. |
| 2 | 20,000+ blockchains cannot talk to each other. Polkadot/Cosmos/LayerZero all require a single consensus model. | **Universal Settlement Layer** — each chain runs on its own consensus; Budlum verifies the proofs. |
| 3 | 130+ countries are piloting CBDCs in isolation. A Turkish citizen cannot use digital lira in Germany. | Each CBDC is a `ConsensusDomain`. `BridgeState` + `ReplayNonceStore` + `CrossDomainMessage` provide trustless cross-sovereign settlement. |
| 4 | TradFi (closed, fast, permissioned) and DeFi (open, slow, risky) cannot interoperate. | `ConsensusKind::PoA` (banks) and `ConsensusKind::PoS` (public) coexist in the same settlement layer, anchored to the same `GlobalBlockHeader`. |
| 5 | AI agents cannot transact value safely or prove the provenance of their decisions. | `ConsensusKind::Custom` (designed for future) + BudZKVM STARK proofs make any decision — including AI decisions — verifiably on-chain. |
| 6 | National digital identity, land registry, social security systems are isolated. Cross-border movement is impossible. | Each nation keeps its own domain (`DomainStatus::Active`/`Frozen`/`Retired`); data is shared via cross-domain messages without sovereignty loss. |
| 7 | Cross-chain bridge hacks stole $2.5B+ in 2022-2024 (Ronin $625M, Wormhole $320M, Nomad $190M). All were trust-minimized at best, never trustless. | `BridgeState`'s lock → mint → burn → unlock lifecycle is end-to-end cryptographically proven. No human approval, no multisig, no oracle. |

## What This Repo Is

Budlum Core (`budlum-core`) is the Rust L1 implementation of the
Universal Settlement Layer. It is one of two sibling repositories:

* `lubosruler/budlum` (this repo) — the L1 settlement engine.
* `lubosruler/BudZero` — the ZK execution layer (BudZKVM).

The two are consumed via Cargo path dependencies; `budlum-core`'s
`Cargo.toml` references `../BudZKVM/bud-isa`, `../BudZKVM/bud-vm`, and
`../BudZKVM/bud-proof`.

---

## Devnet Candidate Features (v0.3)

### Multi-Consensus Settlement (Model B)

* **Verified-Only Commitments** — RPC rejects raw domain commitments;
  settlement updates arrive as `VerifiedDomainCommitment` with a
  matching finality proof hash.
* **Adapter Hardening (all real verification)** — PoW binds the proof
  to the commitment block hash + confirmation depth + internally
  consistent declared cumulative work; PoS and BFT verify a real BLS
  commit certificate against the validator snapshot; ZK resolves
  through the STARK-verified `ProofClaimRegistry`; PoA verifies real
  ed25519 signatures with a count-based quorum, fully isolated from
  the permissionless stake registry.
* **Parent-Linked Domain History** — commitments whose
  `parent_domain_block_hash` does not link to the last committed
  domain block are rejected.
* **Strict Nonce Invariant** — stale or equal nonce updates are
  rejected before durable insertion.
* **Byzantine Resilience** — global state convergence verified via an
  18-test "Chaos Matrix" under simulated partitions and delays.
* **Equivocation Immunity** — protocol-level detection and global
  freezing of conflicting domains; duplicates remain idempotent.
* **Atomic Settlement Persistence** — commitment insertions and
  domain height/hash updates persisted in one storage batch.

### `$BUD` Tokenomics

* **Fixed Supply** — 100,000,000 `$BUD`, 6 decimals
  (`src/tokenomics/mod.rs`). No `total_supply` field; supply is the sum
  of all balances; there is no inflation mint on the burn paths.
* **Genesis Distribution** — Community 10M / Liquidity 10M / Ecosystem
  20M / Team 20M / Burn Reserve 40M (config-driven `TokenomicsParams`,
  validated to sum to exactly 100M). Wired into genesis via the
  opt-in `GenesisConfig::with_bud_tokenomics()`.
* **Team Vesting (enforced)** — standard cliff + linear schedule;
  transfers from the team account are rejected (`vesting_locked`)
  if they would spend below the still-locked portion.
* **Timed Reserve Burn** — time-triggered (epoch-based, not usage-based)
  annual burn of the 40M reserve, fired automatically at each epoch
  transition (`advance_epoch`); strictly reduces supply, never offset
  by a mint.
* **Metabolic Burn** — a configurable fraction of every transaction
  fee is burned instead of paid to the block producer
  (in `Executor::apply_block`).
* *Out of scope (future work): PoSV consensus, `$LUM` token,
  launchpad/presale.*

### Permissionless Participation Registry

* **No Whitelist / No Approval** — validator, verifier and relayer
  participation is open; the only requirement is bonding stake
  (`src/registry/permissionless.rs`). Security is stake + slashing,
  never permission.
* **Staking == Registration** — applying a `Stake` transaction
  automatically registers the account in the registry.
* **Generic, Extensible Roles** — roles are an open `RoleId` (not a
  hard-coded enum), so future application layers can define new roles
  without changing the registry.
* **Config/Governance Parameters** — minimum stake, unbonding window
  and per-offence slash ratios are `RegistryParams` — tunable, not
  hard-coded (`src/registry/params.rs`).
* **Canonical Slashing Evidence** — a single `SlashingReport` format
  (`src/registry/evidence.rs`) is shared by consensus, RPC and other
  domains. Only consensus-verified reports are actioned;
  externally-submitted unverified reports never cause a slash.
* **Relayer-Gated Cross-Domain Messaging** — relayed
  `CrossDomainMessage` submission (RPC + p2p) requires the sender to
  be an active relayer; system-generated bridge events bypass the
  gate. No whitelist — registration is by bonding stake.
* **Anti-Spam Fee for Slashing Reports** — `bud_submitSlashingReport`
  charges `RegistryParams::slashing_report_fee` (default 10) to the
  reporter, refunded when actionable, burned otherwise.
* **Automatic Liveness Slashing** — `LivenessTracker`
  (`src/registry/liveness.rs`) counts consecutive
  missed-participation epochs; crossing the threshold emits a
  consensus-verified liveness report.
* **Permissionless ZK Prover Bridge** — anyone may submit a BudZKVM
  proof via `CrossDomainMessage`; STARK proofs are self-verifying,
  so no registration is required. A small `proof_submission_fee`
  (default 10) is refunded on valid proofs and burned on invalid
  ones. Registering as a `PROVER` is optional and only grants reward
  eligibility. "First valid wins" per `(domain, height)`.
* **Isolated PoA Membership** — the permissioned PoA domain uses a
  completely separate KYC/approval-gated registry
  (`src/registry/poa_membership.rs`); stake never grants PoA
  authority.
* **RPC** — `bud_registryRegister`, `bud_registryBondRelayer`,
  `bud_registryBondProver`, `bud_submitZkProof`, `bud_registryQuery`,
  `bud_registryActiveMembers`, `bud_submitSlashingReport` — all
  permissionless.

### Verified Cross-Domain Bridge

* **Bridge-Enabled Domains Only** — asset registration requires
  active, registered, bridge-enabled domains.
* **Safe Lock Constraints** — source/target domains must differ,
  transfer amount must be non-zero.
* **Raw Burn/Unlock Disabled** — direct bridge burn and unlock calls
  rejected.
* **Proof-Based Return Path** — funds return only after target-domain
  `BridgeBurned` event is committed and verified.

### BLS + Dilithium5 Hybrid Finality Protocol (v0.3)

The core of the post-quantum story. Both are required simultaneously:

* **`BlsKeypair`** — BLS12-381 keypair integrated into
  `ValidatorKeys` with `sign_bls()` / `verify_bls_sig()`.
* **Signed Votes** — validators produce BLS-signed prevote/precommit
  messages.
* **Auto-Precommit** — periodic loop detects prevote quorum and
  automatically signs + broadcasts precommit.
* **Aggregate Verification** — `FinalityCert` verified with BLS
  pairing: `e(sig, G2_gen) == e(H(msg), agg_pk)`.
* **Dilithium5 QC Blob** — every checkpoint carries a post-quantum
  signature from a quorum of validators. The L1 rejects any
  checkpoint whose QC blob does not verify under Dilithium5.
* **Adversarial Tests** — byzantine equivocation rejection, tampered
  aggregate signature detection, full 4-validator flow.

### RPC Hardening (v0.3)

* **Dual Listeners** — separate public and operator HTTP servers.
* **Trusted Proxy** — only configured proxy IPs may set
  `X-Forwarded-For` for client identification.
* **Per-IP Rate Limiting** — independent token buckets per client IP.
* **Health Endpoints** — `bud_health`, `bud_nodeInfo`.
* **Body/Connection Limits** — public 10MB/500 conn, operator
  50MB/10 conn.

### P2P Hardening (v0.3)

* **Persistent Identity** — P2P keypair survives restarts.
* **Durable Peer Bans** — JSON-persisted, reloaded on startup.
* **mDNS Policy** — per-network (`mainnet`/`testnet` off, `devnet` on).
* **DNS Seed Resolution** — resolves hostnames to multiaddrs at startup.

### Snapshot V2 (v0.3)

* **Canonical V2 Format** — full consensus metadata (epoch, base_fee,
  block_reward, unbonding_queue, cross-domain roots, finality certs).
* **Replay Equivalence** — state root matches original.
* **Chunk-Session Binding** — `session_id` prevents cross-peer chunk
  mixing.
* **V2-First Restore** — startup tries V2 snapshot, falls back to V1.

### Observability (v0.3)

* **Prometheus** — chain height, finalized height, blocks produced,
  transactions, reorgs, mempool, P2P messages/peers.
* **Docker** — multi-stage image, 4-node `docker-compose`.
* **systemd** — production unit file.
* **Fuzzing** — 4 `cargo-fuzz` targets (block, transaction, snapshot,
  consensus header).

### Post-Quantum Architecture (Tur 8)

* **Dilithium5 + BLS hybrid finality** in the consensus core.
* **HNDL threat model** documented in
  [`docs/03_post_quantum_security.md`](docs/03_post_quantum_security.md).
* **Tur 9-14 migration roadmap** — key ceremony, validator key
  rotation, governance parameter addition, hybrid signature envelope.

---

## Verification & Test Coverage

* **Total Tests** — `423` (all passing).
* **Byzantine Chaos Matrix** — 18 scenarios.
* **BLS Finality Tests** — sign/verify, aggregator, equivocation,
  certificate tampering, replay.
* **RPC Security Tests** — auth, CORS, IP filtering, rate limiting,
  trusted proxy.
* **P2P Hardening Tests** — persistent identity, durable ban
  roundtrip, DNS seed resolution.
* **Snapshot V2 Tests** — V2 metadata, replay, serialization,
  PruningManager V2.
* **Metrics Tests** — chain metrics emit, counter increments, encoding.
* **Distributed Devnet Simulation** — 5-node libp2p mesh convergence.
* **BudL Compiler Tests** (sibling BudZKVM) — 9/9 match expressions.

## Production Hardening Status

**v0.3-dev** closes 5 of 7 Mainnet blockers. Remaining work: external
security audit, archive-node policy, migration framework, and production
runbooks.

The latest security audit was the **Tur 8 post-quantum + bridge
denetimleri** (see `docs/03_post_quantum_security.md`). The Tur 8 CI
pipeline runs three gates on every push:

1. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
2. `cargo clippy -D warnings`
3. `cargo test --lib`

Read the book's
[**Production Hardening Status**](docs/en/book/ch12_production_hardening.md)
for the full implementation matrix.

Budlum is built for protocol researchers and developers who like
looking under the hood. We welcome technical reviews, protocol design
discussions, and security feedback.

---

## What This Repo Does *Not* Do (Scope Boundaries)

To prevent scope creep, `budlum-core` deliberately excludes the
following:

* **No whitelist / admin-approval / central gate** for validator,
  verifier or relayer roles on the PoW/PoS/BFT domains. Participation
  is **permissionless**: the only requirement is bonding stake (see
  `src/registry/permissionless.rs`). Security comes from stake +
  slashing, never from permission.
* **No fixed or committee-based relayer set.** Anyone can become a
  relayer by staking; there is no hard-coded relayer list.
* **The permissioned PoA domain is an isolated exception, not the
  norm.** PoA membership (`src/registry/poa_membership.rs`) is
  KYC/approval-gated and kept in a completely separate data structure
  from the permissionless registry. PoA's admission rules must not leak
  into other domains, and stake must not grant PoA authority. This
  isolation is enforced by `src/tests/permissionless.rs`.
* **No application-layer logic** (DeEd, SocialFi, B.U.D., Budlum Go,
  DeArt, participation-bank product). This repo is the network / L1
  core only.
* **No bespoke L1↔ZKVM bridge protocol.** Cross-domain interaction
  with BudZKVM goes through the existing `CrossDomainMessage`
  primitive.
